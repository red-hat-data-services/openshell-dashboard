"""The pin move: put a working tree on another upstream release.

Moving to a release is one change (ADR 0009, decision 7). Everything that
comes from the release moves in it, and everything that restates the pins is
brought back in step:

    deploy/ci/gateway-pins.json                  release, images, sdk
    backend/go.mod, backend/go.sum               the SDK at the tag's commit
    backend/pkg/models/gateway_release_line.go   only when the minor changes
    README.md                                    the generated block

The SDK has no tags of its own: it is a directory of the upstream repository.
So it is pinned to the commit the release tag points at, with `go get
<module>@<commit>` and `go mod tidy`. Never `@latest`.

What runs here is `go get`, `go mod tidy` and this repository's own README
script. None of them builds or executes anything from upstream, which is why
the job that holds a write token is allowed to call this.
