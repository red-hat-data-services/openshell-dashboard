"""Everything the workflow writes for a person to read.

The pin commit's message, the `next` pull request, the comment left when
`next` cannot be rebased, the issue check A keeps, and the run summaries.

Two rules about what the text may claim:

  * it says only what this run did or observed. A pull request body is
    written before the push, so it describes the branch, not the run;
  * the pull request body is the same on every run that finds nothing new.
    It carries no run link and no timestamp, so an hourly run that changes
    nothing rewrites nothing.
