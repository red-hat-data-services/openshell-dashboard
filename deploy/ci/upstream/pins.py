"""deploy/ci/gateway-pins.json: load it, validate it, move it to another release.

The pins file names the ONE upstream release a branch is built on (ADR 0009):
the gateway and supervisor images the compatibility suite runs against, and
the Go SDK the BFF is compiled with. They are taken from the same upstream
tag and move together.

Three rules are enforced by validate() rather than left to review:

  * images are pinned by digest (tag@sha256 - the tag is for readers, the
    digest is what gets pulled), and the tag is the release;
  * a release is `X.Y.Z` or a pre-release `X.Y.Z-pre.N`. Which branches may
    pin a pre-release is not decided here: require_stable() is the check CI
    runs for pull requests into `main` and `release/**`;
  * dev / HEAD builds are never pinned. A dev gateway resolves
    ghcr.io/nvidia/openshell/sandbox:dev at runtime, so even a digest-pinned
    dev build drifts with upstream HEAD. That is what broke main on
    2026-10-02.
