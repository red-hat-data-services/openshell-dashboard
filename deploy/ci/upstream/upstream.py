"""Everything the workflow learns from the network, behind one small object.

The decision logic never talks to git or a registry directly: it is handed an
Upstream. Tests hand it a fake built from fixtures, which is what lets every
decision be exercised without a network and without a container.

A lookup that fails for a reason other than "that does not exist" raises. An
outage must stop the run, not be mistaken for "nothing newer was released".
