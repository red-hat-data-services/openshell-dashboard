"""Report rendering: the issue, the step summary and the PR text.

Every row says in words WHICH LINK failed and what to do about it, because the
two links are repaired in different places:

  wire: gateway<->SDK    a real gateway and the BFF built against an SDK
                         disagree at run time. Found only by the compat suite.
                         Fixed by choosing which gateways and which SDK go
                         together, or by adapting the BFF to the gateway.
  source: SDK<->BFF      the BFF does not compile, vet or pass its unit tests
                         against an SDK. No gateway is involved. Fixed by
                         editing BFF code.

A sweep that reported the second as the first is what produced "3 releases
need migration" (#75) for three gateways that worked.

Two rules about what the text may claim:

  * a row says only what the run observed. "Passes", "fails" and "works with
    none" are never said about a lane the run has no result for;
  * the report is written before the PR job runs, so it never says a pull
    request exists. It says which job opens it and what to do if that job
    did not succeed.
