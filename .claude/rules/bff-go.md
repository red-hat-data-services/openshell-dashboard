# Go BFF Conventions

## Directory structure

Everything the BFF exposes lives under `pkg/` so downstream consumers can
import it. There is no `backend/internal/` tree.

## Router

Routes are declared in `pkg/server/app.go` with `go-chi/chi` and dispatch to a
handler struct. Method names carry no `Handler` suffix — the struct does:

```go
func (h *SandboxHandler) ListSandboxes(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)
```

URL params via `r.PathValue("workspace")`. chi populates these through
`SetPathValue` on every matched route (`mux.go`, `routeHTTP`), so handlers do
not import chi. chi added that call in **v5.2.4** — on anything older every
`r.PathValue` silently returns `""`, so treat v5.2.4 as a hard floor and never
downgrade `github.com/go-chi/chi/v5` below it.

## Gateway client

The vendored Go SDK is the source of truth:

```go
import openshell "github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell/sdk/go/openshell/v1"
```

Handlers never hold `openshell.ClientInterface` directly. `NewApp` resolves the
SDK sub-clients once (`Sandboxes()`, `Workspaces()`, `Providers()`, `Exec()`,
`Policy()`, `Services()`, ...), wraps each in a `pkg/services` type, and injects
that interface into the handler as `h.svc`. Downstream can substitute its own
implementation of any `services.*Interface` without forking the handler.

The three intentional exceptions are in `pkg/clients`, and all use the SDK's
generated proto client because of a gap in the public SDK:

- `rawexec.go` streams a file into a sandbox for binary-safe uploads, because
  the public exec API lacks a non-TTY stdin path.
- `rawprovider.go` reads the keys of the credentials a provider holds, because
  the SDK's converter drops the redacted `credentials` map the gateway returns
  them in. `app.SetProviderCredentialKeys` wires it in; handlers reach it
  through `services.ProviderCredentialKeyReader`, beside the SDK call that
  returns the provider itself. `rawprovider_allworkspaces.go` is the same
  read for the all-workspaces provider list.
- `rawprofile.go` reads and writes provider profiles, because the SDK's
  profile endpoint type keeps a host, a port and a protocol and drops the
  access preset, enforcement and L7 rules the gateway stores with them. An
  update replaces the stored profile, so a profile that went through the SDK
  type would come back narrower than it was.

Do not add new local wrappers, copied protos, or generated stub trees unless
there is a concrete upstream SDK gap you can point to, and delete an exception
when its gap closes.

## Mirror the gateway

The BFF translates nothing (see "Stay in parity with the gateway" in
`CLAUDE.md`). A request body carries what the gateway's message carries and is
forwarded as it is; a response carries what the gateway returned, minus
secrets. When a request fails because the gateway wants it another way, change
what the UI sends, not what the BFF forwards. In particular the BFF does not
rename provider credential keys, work out a provider's profile scope, or guess
the type of a setting, and it sends an update only what the request names
rather than a resource it read first.

## Handlers

Handlers use the exported helpers from `pkg/apiutils`:

```go
func (h *SandboxHandler) GetSandbox(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    sandbox, err := h.svc.Get(r.Context(), r.PathValue("workspace"), r.PathValue("name"))
    if err != nil {
        apiutils.WriteSDKError(w, err)
        return
    }
    apiutils.WriteJSON(w, http.StatusOK, models.FromSDKSandbox(sandbox))
}
```

Key patterns:
- `apiutils.DecodeBody(w, r, &dst)` — handles MaxBytesReader, DisallowUnknownFields, writes error response on failure, returns false
- `apiutils.WriteJSON(w, statusCode, payload)` — marshals and writes
- `apiutils.WriteError(w, statusCode, code, message)` — writes ErrorResponse envelope; `code` is an `apiutils.ResponseCode` constant, never a bare string. Add a new constant rather than inlining a literal.
- `apiutils.WriteSDKError(w, err)` — maps SDK and fallback gRPC status errors to HTTP status codes
- `apiutils.ValidDNS1123(name)` — validates resource names
- Convert SDK responses through `models.FromSDK*()` helpers or explicit DTO assembly before serializing to JSON
- For policy JSON, preserve the existing protojson contract through `models.ParseSDKPolicy` / `marshalSDKPolicy`; do not hand-roll `map[string]any` policy parsing

## Auth

Relay-only (ADR 0002): the BFF never terminates authentication. A fronting proxy (oauth2-proxy standalone, the host platform's proxy when embedded) owns login/sessions/refresh/CSRF and injects the bearer.

Bearer resolution is one precedence chain in `pkg/auth/proxy.go`, identical everywhere:

1. `x-forwarded-access-token` header (injected by the fronting proxy)
2. `Authorization: Bearer` header (API clients)
3. No bearer → 401

The token lands in request context; `clients.ContextAuthProvider` forwards it
on every SDK/gRPC call as `authorization: Bearer` metadata. Gateway enforces
RBAC (admin/user roles) and workspace membership — the BFF never does.

The BFF does NOT validate tokens, call JWKS endpoints, parse JWTs, or make authorization decisions. Zero dependency on `go-oidc`. There are no OIDC endpoints, no session codec, no CSRF middleware — if you find yourself adding any of these, stop and read ADR 0002.

Auth-adjacent routes (under `/api/v1/`): `auth/config` (bootstrap: authDisabled + feature flags), `auth/whoami` (gateway `GetCurrentUser`). That's all.

Before adding anything auth-adjacent, check ADR 0002: no auth termination, no JWT validation, no RBAC, no k8s API calls, no credential brokering, no server-side state.

## Configuration

Env vars (some also available as CLI flags):

| Env Var | Flag | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | `-port` | `8080` | BFF listen port |
| `LISTEN_ADDRESS` | `-listen-address` | | Optional listen address override |
| `OPENSHELL_GATEWAY_URL` | `-gateway-url` | `localhost:50051` | Gateway gRPC endpoint |
| `GATEWAY_CA_CERT` | `-gateway-ca-cert` | | CA cert for gateway TLS |
| `GATEWAY_CLIENT_CERT` | `-gateway-client-cert` | | Client cert for gateway mTLS |
| `GATEWAY_CLIENT_KEY` | `-gateway-client-key` | | Client key for gateway mTLS |
| `TLS_CERT_FILE` | `-tls-cert` | | Server cert for inbound BFF HTTPS |
| `TLS_KEY_FILE` | `-tls-key` | | Server key for inbound BFF HTTPS |
| `STATIC_DIR` | `-static-dir` | | Frontend static assets directory |
| `AUTH_DISABLED` | `-auth-disabled` | `false` | Skip auth — dev only |
| `AUTH_TOKEN_HEADER` | `-auth-token-header` | `x-forwarded-access-token` | Token header name |
| `AUTH_USER_HEADER` | `-auth-user-header` | `x-auth-request-user` | User header name |
| `ADMIN_ROLE` | `-admin-role` | `admin` | OIDC role claim for admin (display gating only — gateway enforces) |
| `LOGOUT_URL` | `-logout-url` | `/oauth2/sign_out` | Proxy sign-out path the frontend redirects to on logout |
| `GATEWAY_SUPPORTED_MIN` | `-gateway-supported-min` | | Oldest gateway release this build supports, plain `x.y.z`. Set together with `GATEWAY_SUPPORTED_MAX`; with either unset or unparsable, `compatibility.status` is `unknown`. The verdict is served by `GET /gateway/compatibility` to every signed-in user (version read from the gateway's unauthenticated health check) and also rides on `GET /gateway`, which the gateway answers for platform admins only. Informational only — the BFF never blocks on it |
| `GATEWAY_SUPPORTED_MAX` | `-gateway-supported-max` | | Newest gateway release this build was tested against, plain `x.y.z`. Both are derived from the required lanes in `deploy/ci/gateway-pins.json` (`make dev` does this) — never hand-write a range |
| `FEATURE_*` | | varies | Feature flags: `FEATURE_TERMINAL`, `FEATURE_FILE_TRANSFER`, `FEATURE_SETTINGS`, `FEATURE_GLOBAL_POLICY`, `FEATURE_CREDENTIAL_REFRESH`, `FEATURE_SERVICES`, `FEATURE_DRAFT_POLICY` |

## Error handling

Standard error envelope:

```go
type ErrorResponse struct {
    Code    ResponseCode `json:"code"`
    Message string       `json:"message"`
}
```

`ResponseCode` is a string enum in `pkg/apiutils/respond.go`. Every code the BFF
can return is declared there so the frontend has one authoritative list.

## Testing

- Table-driven tests with `*_test.go` adjacent to implementation
- `httptest.NewRecorder()` + `http.NewRequest()` for handler tests
- `mock_sdk_test.go` provides `openshell.ClientInterface` test doubles for handler coverage
- `rawexec_test.go`, `rawprovider_test.go` (with `rawprovider_allworkspaces_test.go`) and `rawprofile_test.go` cover the three low-level gRPC escape hatches against a fake gateway that enforces the real one's 1 MiB message limit
- `slog` for structured logging

## SDK updates

The SDK pin is the commit of an upstream **release tag** and it moves in a PR
of its own. Never `go get ...@latest`, a branch or a pre-release tag: `@latest`
is whatever upstream HEAD is that minute, and nothing was tested against it
(ADR 0006; hard facts 17 and 20 in `openshell-api.md`).

You normally do not do this by hand. The daily compat sweep tries the newest
release's SDK against every required gateway lane and proposes the PR when it
passes (`fix(sdk): move to the OpenShell SDK at vX`, on the branch
`compat-sweep/sdk`). When it reports a **source migration** instead — the BFF
no longer builds against the new SDK — that is the one case for doing it
yourself:

```bash
# The commit a release tag points at (take the ^{} line when the tag has one).
git ls-remote --tags https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell.git 'v0.1.*'

cd backend
go get github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell/sdk/go@<release-tag-commit>
go mod tidy
go build ./... && go vet ./... && go test ./...   # the source link: SDK <-> BFF
```

Then, in the same PR:

- Write the new version into the `sdk` field of `deploy/ci/gateway-pins.json`.
  It is the go.mod pin recorded a second time and CI fails when they differ
  (`python3 deploy/ci/sweep/sweep.py validate-pins --go-mod backend/go.mod`).
- Fix the call sites and the test doubles in `mock_sdk_test.go`, and commit
  them with the pin: a commit that moves the SDK without them does not build.
- Do **not** move a gateway lane. The required compat lanes prove the wire
  link (gateway <-> SDK) against every gateway we support; a moved lane would
  hide which link changed.
- Use a `fix:` commit. The published BFF is built against the SDK, so the
  move has to be released.

If the new SDK fails the floor lane, moving to it drops a supported gateway.
That is a decision about the supported range, not a dependency bump. Stop and
raise it. The one case where the SDK and the lanes do move in a single PR is
a wire break no build spans — the new SDK fails every required lane and the
pinned SDK fails every new gateway — and that PR is a person's decision,
recorded as such (ADR 0006, decision 6). It is never a routine update and the
sweep never opens it.

There is no local proto regeneration flow anymore. If you need to inspect an
RPC or type shape, read the vendored SDK package (`openshell/v1`, `types/*`) or
use `go doc`. `pkg/models/policyproto.go` intentionally uses the SDK's
vendored `proto/sandboxv1` package only to preserve the frontend's protojson
policy contract; do not reintroduce `backend/proto/`, `backend/gen/`, or an
`backend/internal/` wrapper layer.
