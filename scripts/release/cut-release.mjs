// Cuts a console release from the checked-out commit, or says what it would cut.
//
// publish.yml runs this: for a person who started the workflow on main or on
// release/<major>.<minor>, and for the merge of `next`. Whether to release was
// decided before it runs. This works out which release it is:
//
//   the version   <line>.<n>, from the OpenShell release this branch pins and
//                 the release tags that exist (next-version.mjs). Nobody
//                 chooses it and no commit title goes into it.
//   the notes     the commits since the previous release, then the gateways
//                 the release supports (release-notes.mjs).
//
// Then it creates the GitHub release, and GitHub creates the tag vX.Y.Z at
// this commit with it, in one request. The image tags and the chart follow
// from that tag in later jobs (released-version.mjs).
//
// With --dry-run it prints all of that and creates nothing. A dry run needs no
// token and no network; everything it says comes from the checkout. What it
// prints names every release tag the version was worked out from, because a
// tag that should not be there is the one way the number comes out wrong.
//
// Four things stop it, each with a message that says what to do:
//
//   - The checkout is shallow. The tags and the history are what everything
//     here is worked out from.
//   - The branch pins a pre-release. Only `next` does, and nothing is
//     released from one.
//   - The branch is release/X.Y and pins another line than X.Y.
//   - The newest release of the line is not in this commit's history. Numbers
//     on a line are given out in order, so a release from here would be
//     numbered above one it does not contain, and the X.Y image tag would
//     move back to older code. This is what a second run for an old commit
//     looks like, and a release branch that main has released past.
//
// A real run, and only a real run, stops for one more: a counted release tag
// whose commit was not built for the line, which is what a tag from before
// this numbering is. A dry run shows the number it leads to and warns.
//
// A commit that already carries a release tag of its line is released: the
// script says so and succeeds. That makes a workflow run safe to re-run after
// a later job failed: the re-run is for the same commit, finds the tag, and
// goes on to the image tags and the chart.
