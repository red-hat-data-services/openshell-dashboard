// semantic-release plugin: a person chooses what kind of release to cut.
//
// Loaded by release.config.cjs in place of @semantic-release/commit-analyzer.
//
// semantic-release normally reads the commits since the last release and
// decides for itself: a `feat:` title is a minor, a `fix:` is a patch, and one
// `!` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer is a major. That made merging a pull request
// with the right title the same act as publishing, and it is how 1.0.0 was
// published by a single footer nobody meant as a milestone.
//
// Here the kind of release comes from RELEASE_TYPE, which publish.yml sets from
// the choice the person made when they started the workflow (or to `patch` for
// a merged compat-sweep bump, the one release that is still automatic). The
// commits are still read, but only to say what they would have suggested, so a
// choice that disagrees with them is made knowingly.
//
// Without RELEASE_TYPE the step fails. That is the point: nothing can be
// released by running semantic-release without having said what to release.
