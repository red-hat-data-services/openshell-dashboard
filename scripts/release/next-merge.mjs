// Did this commit reach main by merging `next`?
//
// A release is started by a person (docs/releasing.md), with one exception:
// the move to a new OpenShell release. That move is prepared on the `next`
// branch by the Follow upstream workflow and reaches main as the pull request
// from `next` (ADR 0009, decisions 7 and 8). Its whole purpose is to change
// what the next release is built on and declares, and it is the release most
// likely to be forgotten. So publish.yml releases it by itself once it is
// merged and CI has passed on main.
//
// "It came from next" has to be established from where the commit came from,
// not from what it is called. A title can be typed by anyone. This asks the
// one question that cannot be answered by typing: was the commit merged into
// main by a pull request whose head was the branch `next` in THIS repository?
//
// A fork can name a branch `next` too, so the head repository counts, not
// only the branch name. With "Rebase and merge" GitHub associates every
// commit the merge put on main with the pull request, so the tip that CI ran
// for answers for all of them.
//
// Prints `from=next` or `from=` in GITHUB_OUTPUT form. An empty answer is the
// ordinary one and is not an error.
//
