// The version of the next console release. It is computed, never chosen.
//
// The console shares the gateway's minor release line (ADR 0009): console
// 0.1.x is for gateway 0.1.x. So the first two numbers of a release are not
// anybody's to pick. They are the line of the OpenShell release the branch is
// built on, which deploy/ci/gateway-pins.json names. The third number counts
// the console's own releases on that line:
//
//   line     major.minor of the pinned release
//   version  <line>.<n>, where n is one more than the highest patch among the
//            release tags v<line>.* that exist, and 0 when there is none
//
// That is the whole rule. The first release after the pin moves to a new
// gateway minor comes out as X.Y.0 because that line has no tag yet, and
// every other release is the next patch: a console never starts a minor on
// its own (ADR 0009, decision 4). Nothing here reads a commit title, and
// there is no release type to get wrong.
//
// The tags counted are the ones that exist, wherever they point. A patch cut
// from release/0.1 after main moved to 0.2 is counted for 0.1 and for nothing
// else. cut-release.mjs is what reads the repository; this file only does the
// arithmetic, so that it can be tested without one.

// A console release tag: vX.Y.Z and nothing after it. v1.2.0-beta.1 and
// v1.2.0+build are not releases, and neither is anything without the v.
