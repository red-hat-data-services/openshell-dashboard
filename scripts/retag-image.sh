# CI builds one image per commit and tags it sha-<commit>. Every other tag is a
# statement about that same image, made later by something that knows more:
#
#   latest        ci.yml, once the whole pipeline has passed on the tip of main
#   X.Y.Z, X.Y    publish.yml, once a release vX.Y.Z has been cut at that commit
#
# Rebuilding for either would put a new image, built later, under a tag that
# claims to be the one from that commit. So both resolve the sha- tag to its
# digest and point the new tags at that digest.
#
# `docker buildx imagetools create` with a single source that is a manifest
# list (ours is: linux/amd64 + linux/arm64) "performs a carbon copy", in the
# words of its reference: the new tag gets the source's digest, and nothing
# moves but the manifest. The script checks that afterwards rather than
# trusting it.
#
# A version tag, X.Y.Z, is WRITE-ONCE. `latest` and X.Y are meant to move; a
# release is not. If X.Y.Z already names another digest the script fails and
# pushes nothing, not even the other tags it was given. That can really happen:
# "Re-run all jobs" on a released commit's CI run builds the commit again, the
# new build has a new digest (its labels carry the build time), and sha-<commit>
# is re-pointed at it. Without this rule the release's tag would follow, and
# anyone who had recorded the released digest would no longer match. The rule
# goes by the shape of the tag, not by a flag, so no caller can forget it.
# Re-tagging X.Y.Z with the digest it already has is fine and does nothing.
#
# DRY_RUN=1 resolves the digests and prints the command without running it.
# Needs docker buildx, jq, and a login that can push to IMAGE.
