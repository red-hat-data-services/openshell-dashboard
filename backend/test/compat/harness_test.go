//go:build compat

// Package compat is the gateway compatibility suite. It drives the BFF's REST
// API against a real OpenShell gateway and asserts the contracts the frontend
// depends on.
//
// It is build-tagged so `go test ./...` never picks it up — it needs a live
// stack. CI runs it once per gateway version in a matrix; see
// .github/workflows/ci.yml and deploy/ci/.
//
//	BFF_URL=http://localhost:9080 go test -tags compat -count=1 ./test/compat/... -v
//
// This suite is the only proof of the gateway <-> SDK link: the compiler and
// the unit tests prove that the BFF fits the SDK, but only a request that
// crosses the wire proves that the SDK we pin still speaks the protocol of a
// given gateway. So the map below is organized by what crosses the wire.
//
// # What a green lane looks like
//
// Almost every test drives the gateway through the BFF's real routes. The ones
// in guard_test.go do not: they check the suite's own guards against canned
// answers and send the gateway nothing.
//
// A green lane on gateways 0.1.0 to 0.1.2 has no test that SKIPs. The skips
// the suite can produce all say why: a known bug (see the end of this comment,
// none at present), a gateway that is not this run's own (the writing subtests
// of TestGlobalSettings, TestGlobalPolicy and TestSandboxSettings, and all of
// TestSandboxSettingManagedGlobally), a compute driver other than the compat
// stack's Docker (TestRuntimeClassReachesTheDriver), a delete the gateway only
// accepted, or a BFF started without a supported gateway range
// (TestGatewayCompatibility, which CI always gives one). On the disposable
// gateway CI uses, any skip, or any failure, is news. The comment does not
// state how many tests there are: a count is wrong as soon as another change
// adds a test.
//
// # Coverage map
//
// Covered, one test per capability the UI depends on:

//	               own workspace; a workspace's endpoints; the

//	list shapes    lists are JSON arrays, not pager envelopes  contract_test.go
//
// Most of these tests run in a workspace other than "default" on purpose.
// Every workspace-scoped call carries a workspace selector, and only a second
// workspace can show that the selector is honored rather than merely present:
// a call that always said "default" would pass a suite that never used
// anything else.
//
// Deliberately not covered, and why:
//
//   - Inference routes and a standalone exec endpoint: the BFF has no such
//     routes. Non-interactive exec is reachable only through file transfer,
//     which is where it is covered.
//   - auth/whoami: the BFF answers it without calling the gateway, because
//     this stack runs with AUTH_DISABLED.
//   - Deciding a real draft chunk (approve, reject, edit, undo), and a draft
//     summary that counts one: chunks are produced only by the in-sandbox
//     supervisor's policy analysis, which a test cannot trigger on demand.
//     The endpoints are driven against an empty inbox instead, which still
//     proves each RPC reaches the gateway.
//   - A successful credential-refresh configuration: it needs a profile that
//     declares a token endpoint and a live OAuth server behind it.
//   - GPU requests on create: the compat stack has no GPU to give.
//   - A runtime class or a driver config that takes effect: the compat
//     stack's Docker driver refuses the first and its gateway has not enabled
//     the second. Each refusal is asserted, which proves the field arrives.
//   - Request validation the BFF does on its own (bad names, bad paths,
//     malformed bodies): it never reaches the gateway, so it belongs in the
//     handler unit tests.
//   - WatchSandbox, ForwardTcp and SSH sessions: not wired into the BFF.
//
// # What the suite does to the gateway
//
// The suite is written for a disposable gateway, which is what CI and
// deploy/ci/e2e-stack.sh give it, but it must not damage one that is not.
// Almost everything it creates is its own and has a random name: workspaces,
// sandboxes (some of them in "default"), providers, templates, and one
// platform-scoped provider profile per provider test, which every workspace
// lists until that test ends.
//
// Three tests change state that belongs to the whole gateway, and all read
// before they write:
//
//   - TestGlobalSettings sets and unsets a setting, and only one the gateway
//     reports as unset. The value it writes is what the gateway does anyway
//     while the setting is unset.
//   - TestSandboxSettingManagedGlobally does the same with the same setting,
//     to see a sandbox report it and refuse to override it.
//   - TestGlobalPolicy sets and removes a global policy, and only when none is
//     in force. A global policy replaces the policy of every sandbox on the
//     gateway and blocks their own policy updates while it is set.
//
// All three also stand down when the gateway runs a sandbox this run did not
// create (see foreignSandboxes), because gateway scope wins over sandbox scope
// for settings and policy alike. In each of those cases the writing subtests
// skip and say exactly what they found, and the reads are still asserted. None
// of them removes anything it cannot show it wrote.
//
// TestDeleteUnsetGlobalSetting sends the gateway a delete too, for a setting
// it has just read as unset. That removes nothing and moves no revision, so
// it runs on a shared gateway as well.
//
// What a run cannot take back: every global policy it sets stays in the
// revision history as SUPERSEDED, and the settings revision counter moves on.
// A run that is killed leaves behind whatever its cleanups would have removed:
// workspaces, sandboxes, a platform profile and, if it dies in the instant
// between a set and its delete, that setting or global policy.
//
// # Known bugs
//
// A test that hits a product bug probes for it and calls t.Skip with a message
// starting "KNOWN BUG:" only when it sees that exact failure, so it starts
// asserting again by itself once the bug is fixed, and the probe is removed
// with the fix so that the bug coming back is a failure. There are none at
// present.
//
// A probe is only as good as the request it sends. Send what the UI sends: a
// test that keeps sending a request the UI no longer makes goes on reporting a
// bug that is gone.
